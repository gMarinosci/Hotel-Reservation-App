# HotelProject

## NOTE: As you may notice by looking at the code, it all may look a little bit confusing, that is because thiw was meant to be a project for groups of 8-10 people, but my group was made of only 3 people so we could not finish it 100%. But because of my group being so small, the teacher still graded the project with a B, and I got an A as final grade for my efforts in the project 

The project this year is to create a hotel booking system for a small hotel.
You are going to create a desktop application using JavaFX and connect it to a MySQL database.
The system should work for a hotel with about 20 -- 80 rooms, but you want to make it as flexible as possible.
The program is only going to be used by staff at the hotel, never by the guests, 
but there are two types of staff -- reception staff and administrators -- with different privileges.
Below, "user" means both user types, otherwise they are specified.

- You can, and should, define a number of user stories for the hotel system, but below are a handful of them that we want you to implement. You can add to these (and probably should), but not remove them.

1. As a user, I should be able to start the application and see a welcome screen
2. As a user, I must be able to set and change my screen name and my password
3. As an administrator, I need to be able to add a room with details (size, beds, number, location and other information)
4. As an administrator, I should be able to change the details of a room
5. As an administrator, I can delete a room
6. As an administrator, I can add a user as either reception staff or administrator
7. As a reception staff, I must be able to see details of a room
8. As a reception staff, I can see all the bookings for a specific day
9. As a reception staff, I can see all the bookings for a specific room
10. As a reception staff, I must be able to book a room for a specific date range
11. As a reception staff, I can see an overview of the bookings
12. As a reception staff, I will be able to change a booking
13. As a reception staff, I can mark a room booking as paid
14. As a reception staff, I can create a customer with data (name, address, payment method etc)
15. As a reception staff, I can change details for a customer
16. As a reception staff, I must be able to search for a booking
17. As a reception staff, I can search for available free dates for rooms
- Notice that several of the user stories can be implemented in several ways. The last one, for example, can be a straight search for a date and a room, or for several rooms in a range of dates.
- Add the above user stories to your GitLab repository and add more that you find useful
